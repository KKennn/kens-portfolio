        <h2>01 Research</h2>
        <h3>Interview with parents and kids</h3>
        <p>I interviewed 10 parents who were concerned about their children's overusing electronic devices. I also interviewed their kids.</p>
        <p class="interview-heading">Parents said,</p>
        <p>"My kids always try to violate rules of using iPad."</p>
        <p>"I want my kid to have a fruitful childhood."</p>
        <p>"I hardly have any time or methods to manage my kid’s life."</p>
        <p class="interview-heading">Children said,</p>
        <p>"I like playing video games for a long time."</p>
        <p>"I know the benefits of keeping a regular life but sometimes I just can’t control myself."</p>
        <p>"My plan is often disrupted because I want to play video games."</p>
        <h3>Shadowing</h3>
        <p>Setting a time limit is a common parental control over electronic devices. I shadowed 5 children and saw how they responded to it.</p>

        <h2>02 Analyze</h2>
        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p>The interview and shadowing show: Kids don't respond well to game time limit. They want to finish homework and plans but they procrastinate because of addiction to games. I sorted out characteristics, current solutions, and demands of target users.</p>

        <h3>Storyboard</h3>
        <p>I illustrated the pain point: Kids try to have a plan and control their usage of electronic devices, but their lack of self-management skills restrains them. </p>

        <h3>Problem Tree</h3>
        <p>I defined causes and effects of the core problem: the overuse of electronic devices.</p>

        <h2>03 Brainstorm</h2>
        <p>I brainstormed three concepts to address the pain point here. After evaluation, I chose to design an interactive box that prints “mission cards” for children to "clock out" after completing plans. It also regulates iPad usage with an app.</p>

        <h2>04 Create</h2>
        <h3>Workflow & Wireframe</h3>
        <p class="workflow">Set up a timetable<br>→Mission card printed at scheduled time<br>→Clock out after completing the "mission"<br>→Unlock game time!</p>
