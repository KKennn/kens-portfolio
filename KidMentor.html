                <h3>Interview with parents and kids</h3>
                <p>I interviewed 10 parents who were concerned about their children's overusing electronic devices. I also interviewed their kids.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p class="interview-heading">Parents said,</p>
                <p>"My kids always try to violate rules of using iPad."</p>
                <p>"I want my kid to have a fruitful childhood."</p>
                <p>"I hardly have any time or methods to manage my kid’s life."</p>

                <p>"I like playing video games for a long time."</p>
                <p>"I know the benefits of keeping a regular life but sometimes I just can’t control myself."</p>

                <h3>Shadowing</h3>
                <p>Setting a time limit is a common parental control over electronic devices. I shadowed 5 children and saw how they responded to it.</p>

                <h3>Persona</h3>
                <p>The interview and shadowing show: Kids don't respond well to game time limit. They want to finish homework and plans but they procrastinate because of addiction to games. I sorted out characteristics, current solutions, and demands of
                    target users.</p>

        <h2>03 Brainstorm</h2>
        <p>I brainstormed three concepts to address the pain point here. After evaluation, I chose to design an interactive box that prints “mission cards” for children to "clock out" after completing plans. It also regulates iPad usage with an app.</p>

        <h3>Workflow & Wireframe</h3>
        <p>Set up a timetable<br>→Mission card printed at scheduled time<br>→Clock out after completing the "mission"<br>→Unlock game time!</p>
