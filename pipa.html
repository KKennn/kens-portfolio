        <h1>PiPa Magazine Website Redesign</h1>
        <!-- <h3>About this project</h3> -->
        <p>PiPa Magazine's website is an e-commerce platform which also has features like online reading, audio books, blog posts, and donation portals. It serves 5000+ subscribers and 7000+ registered users. This magazine has the mission to teach Chinese
            and introduce cultural heritages to second-generation Chinese immigrants.</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The website of PiPa hadnâ€™t changed its format and layout since it debuted in 2013. The outdated visuals and user experience didn't attract as much traffic as it had done. Thus, PiPa faced some challenges to increase the sales and continue its
            mission. <br>Because PiPa Magazine is a small non-profit organization, the website revamp team it hired only consisted of volunteers who also had a full-time job or education. </p>
        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <p>After overhauling the old website, I set up a new, modern visual style with a page structure and color palette representative of its position as a children magazine. I streamlined the checkout user flow to make the process faster and more friendly.
            I also needed to always consider the development effort while redesigning the website since the entire team were using their time off-work/campus to contribute voluntarily. After discussing with developers, I found similarities among different
            functions across the website and built a design system of page titles, dropdown menus, buttons, etc. that can be used in many scenarios, in order to optimize the development process. </p>
